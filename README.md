## Application Instructions

These instructions provide a simple guide to using the application.


## User Login

To log in, use your email as the username and your ID as the password.
For the admin account, use the following credentials:
Username: tim@test.nl

Password: 1


## Task Assignment

You can assign tasks to any user as long as they belong to one of the five predefined departments.
After assigning a task, log in to the specific user account to view the task on their dashboard.


## Changing User Credentials

When changing user credentials in the settings, pay close attention to the newly created email as it will be used for logins.
Note that updates to the CSV file, which stores user data, may not reflect immediately in the application. Restart the program to ensure it's up to date with the newest changes.


## Future Updates

Future updates will include adding password functionality for improved security.
The dashboard will also be enhanced to load tasks, as currently, they are only written to the database.
